If you’ve ever played with arcospheres in space exploration, and wanted to play more with them, then this mod is for you.

This is an independent mod that adds 5 different tiers of arcospheres, and changes every recipe to require arcospheres and arcosphere management all throughout the game. Recipes are automatically generated, so if it isn't already compatible with an overhaul mod, it will be soon.

For those who don’t know what arcospheres are, they are a group of fairly valuable intermediates. Each tier of arcosphere has a set of different states it can be in. Every recipes take in 2 arcospheres of certain states, and returns 2 arcospheres of different states, meaning they are never used or destroyed. In order to maintain a steady supply of all different arcosphere states for crafting, you must change their states with folding recipes in arcofolders. Higher tiers of arcospheres have more possible states and more complicated folding recipes, and are used to craft more advanced items. Additionally, more efficient versions of intermediate recipes are added that use higher tiers of arcospheres.
WIP:

    Compatibility with overhauls that change science packs
    Unique graphics for Arcofabulators and McArcofolders
    Difficulty settings
    Any bugs that may appear when playing (please tell us in discussion)

The Arcos:

    Arcobeads: Rock, Paper, Scissors

This mod was a collab between me and ArchEzekiel, who did a huge portion of the code and graphics.
